## Getting Started
Below will contain the steps needed to get P64 started, up and running.

<Callout title="Dependence on SDL">
  Since there are C++ files in the project, it will need to be built and SDL is a dependency. This means SDL will need to be installed
</Callout>

## Cloning the Repository
To get the files for P64 to build manually, we need to obtain the code, to do this, we clone the repository that is hosted on GitHub.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WillKirkmanM/p64 --recursive
```

## Running P64
Luckily for us, Rust during the run command will compile the packages for your system.
```bash
cargo run --release
```

Interpreters are functions that we write in our programming langage without a requirement of them to be compiled into machine code.

We can take a function like SWV to see the interpreted code

```rust
fn swv(n64: &mut N64, opcode: u32) {
    // Calculate the base address by adding the sign-extended offset to the base register value
    let base_address = n64.rsp.registers.gpr[rs(opcode) as usize]
          .wrapping_add(sign_extend_7bit_offset(voffset(opcode), 4));

    // Determine the starting element in the vector register
    let start_element = velement(opcode);

    // Calculate the initial base address offset within an 8-byte boundary
    let initial_base = base_address & 7;

    // Align the base address to the nearest 8-byte boundary
    let aligned_address = base_address & ADDR_ALIGN_MASK;

    // Get the vector register index from the Operation Code
    let vpr_register = rt(opcode) as usize;

    // Iterate over each element in the vector
    (0..ELEMENT_COUNT).for_each(|offset| {
        // Calculate the current element index
        let current_element = start_element + offset;

        // Calculate the current base address offset
        let current_base = initial_base.wrapping_add(offset as u32);

        // Calculate the memory address to store the byte
        let mem_addr = ((aligned_address + (current_base & BASE_MASK)) & ADDR_MASK) as usize;

        // Store the byte from the vector register to memory
        n64.rsp.memory.mem[mem_addr] = get_vpr_byte(n64.rsp.registers.vpr[vpr_register], current_element);
    });
}
```

## But, How do you know what to execute?
During the process of reading the source code, one instruction at a time, each instruction is decoded through the Opcode and then executed immediately.

And through this, can get the needed instruction and execute the function that is mapped to the original location.
